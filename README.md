***UNDER CONSTRUCTION***

> Somewhere in time and space, the ghosts of Barbara and Adam Maitland notice a tiny light, beckoning from the graveyard of the miniature town that Adam has built.
>
> "Adam," Barbara calls, moving towards the slow, deliberate flashing. "Look. It's him - Betelgeuse."
>
> Recalling that she isn't supposed to speak his name aloud - lest he be summoned into being - she puts a hand over her mouth. But an instant later, an impish smirk alights on her face, and she intones again:
>
> "Betelgeuse..."
>
> She looks to her husband for some rebuke that might dissuade her from this naughtiness.
>
> "Go ahead, Barbara. Say it," he goads her.
>
> "Betelgeuse!"
>
> There is a flash of light, and the world swirls around them. When they recover from the vertigo, they're in another place, among the grassy hills. But this grass is made of plastic.
>
> "What happened," Barbara gasps.
>
> Looking around to confirm his suspicions, Adam delivers his assessment:
>
> "I think we're in the model."


# Ideogram

## What Is It?

Ideogram helps you to build and visualize conceptual data models.

Data models are communication tools for understanding the structure of information. In order to do this effectively, they must be easy for end users to interpret, discuss, and interact with. Regardless of any formal training in data modelling, or the complexity of the model.

But complex data model diagrams can look like spiderwebs, when they try to present everything at once.

Ideogram allows you to build, view, navigate, and learn about data models - one piece at a time.

## Motivation

As humans, much of our time and effort goes into organizing and making use of information.

Digital data - that can be quickly processed and manipulated in software systems - is transforming the way we work, across all sorts of industries and disciplines.

But many industries find it impossible to use data models as a tool to communicate about the information that is their lifeblood, and the systems that manage it.

This is because data modelling tools have complex interfaces, and highly technical diagramming conventions. They focus on adhering to academic and formal standards, such as IDEFx1 and the Information Engineering Methodology.

Although this may be appropriate for naturally technical disciplines - such as the military and aviation - other professions may find very formal diagrams a barrier to understanding. And as such, of little use for fostering a common understanding of the structure and meaning of data across all those who have to work with it.

On top of that, the software is often very costly, meaning that even when an organization sees value in data models, it is only willing to buy licences for a select few members, with special responsibility for data modelling. This means that only those who are already deemed experts in data modelling can familiarize themselves with the tools, and their visual language.

At best, this creates an ivory tower. At worst, it undermines the case for adopting a data modelling tool in the first place.

A justification for the formalism and high cost of data modelling tools is their ability to generate source code - usually SQL Data Definition Language - that can build the models they contain in many commercial database management systems.

This is not the goal of Ideogram.

Ideogram's principal focus is to simplify and democratize the process of data modelling, allowing users to easily build, explore, and take control of their data models.
